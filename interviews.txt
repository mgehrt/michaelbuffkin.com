Q1. Damn that's a hard question. I mean we have buying a $100 boat, doing burnouts through bank parking lots, and going 100+ mph on 2 wheel death traps, but I have one in particular.
It was fall time, just the two of us went to Tuttle with the jetskis to have some fun. It was windy as hell (typical Kansas) so jumping the waves wasn't an issue. It was nearing the end of the day, we loaded up my ski and was taking one last "lap" on his jet ski. This consists of keeping it pinned wide open and jumping every wave we see in sight for at least 5 minutes. We notice it starts to get slower (typical for Mike's jet ski) but we pop the seat off to make sure everything was good. Indeed it was not good, the hull was filled with at least 50% water and the exhaust was hot enough to fry some eggs. Then we go to start it to get back to shore, and the fucking thing won't start. So we are like well shit, we need to get out of the middle of the lake. So we begin to swim this half floating jet ski to the shore, and like 15 minutes later we find a shore. We realize it isn't going to start, and we are a ways away from the marina. So we then proceed to walk, climb and swim from the shore to get to the marina to get my jet ski to pull it back. This all takes probably 40 minutes, and the sun is definitely setting. We finally get both jet skis loaded up and by the time we unload them at his house it's almost dark. Needless to say, we didn't have much faith in his jet ski after that day.
- a month later the engine blew up.

Q2. There's been many songs that Dirty Mike has sang, including hits like Friends in Low Places and Country Roads. But one song in particular seems to describe Dirty Mike at his finest, and that is Dirty White Boy by Foreigner.

Q3. Yes, many, many times I thought he, myself or both would die. There is one time that I think we both shit our pants though. We were on a typical motorcycle ride and on a new road for us, and going through some tighter turns we both came in a little too hot. He (being closer to the center line) went blowing across to the other lane of the road while trying to get his bike slowed down. Fortunately he kept it on the pavement and there was no traffic coming but that was a pretty sketchy deal.
